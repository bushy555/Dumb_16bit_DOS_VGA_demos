1.0 Information.

  1.1 What is it?

Boot Fun is a silly little program that I wrapped up very quickly so that I
could save the different boot sector programs much quicker and easier than 
loading up (SLOW!) Nortons DISKEDIT or by typing "W 100 0 0 1" in Debug. 
Umm... well... maybe not.

Currently it includes:
DOS 5 boot, "Fire", "Sig", "My-disk", "drive A:", "drive C:", "walk", "COLOUR",
Boot_B, Boot_C, and Serial number changer.

Maybe version 2 will include some more of my useless converions of other
programs to work within about 480 bytes. 

Both Fire and Sig can be shown as demo's or, as with the other four, can be 
just a small surprise to someone when they accidently leave the disk in A: 
before boot-up has been completed. Or use it on your enemie's Hard Drive, when
they aren't looking!. ("Would I do this....?")

I place Sig on all of the disks I hand out to people, so that (hopefully), 
if they ever "accidently" forget to give the disk back to me, and they do
reboot one day with the disk still in the drive, they see a message:
"THIS IS BUSHY'S DISK!" and again, hopefully, they'll give the disk back to
me and not just format the disk. 

Or you could place a small funny caption in Sig and look at the faces of
so called "computer gurus" when they see such a thing and let them work it
out. "YOUR COMPUTER IS NOW STONED" will make people look a second time, and
is sometimes rather amusing.

Once whatever program is saved to floppy, wack or leave the disk in A:, 
and run BOOT.COM, hit the reboot button, hit the power-point switch or pull
the cord. After the computer does its POST (power on self test), normally
it will "ask" A: if there is a floppy in the drive and will then execute the
boot program on A:. That program detects if the floppy has a system on it - 
command.com, io.sys, dos.sys. With these programs, they are executed
straight away without any system loaded. 


NOTE: Will only work with the A: Floppy or C: Hard-drive for the boot-up effect,
      unless you change your configurations around within your BIOS.

      BootFun will allow you to save to either drive A: thru to drive D:

      If it doesn't work staright away, check within your BIOS setup that
      drive A: has boot up precedence before drive C:. I only know of AMI
      BIOS which has this feature. I'm not sure about the newer versions
      of DTK, Phoneix, ... etc ...

      There is in any way, no such virus, trojan horse, time bomb etc in this
       program. I would have killed my own system if there had of been.

      If you can find one, then I'll be more than happy to hear about your
       complaints about this program. 


ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

  1.2 Program Info.

At the time of writing this silly .DOC file, BOOTFUN.COM was about 3720 bytes
in length. It could have been as small as about 3400 bytes, or smaller... but
that would of been pushing what user-friendly stuff already exists. It will
be PK'lited, which may reduce the size slightly.

It was written in a few hours (Still learning ASM...) using DEBUG. Then it
was transported over to MASM... MASM throws NOP's into the code just for
good luck and therefore greatly increases the size. It is a bugger, I know.
ThenI decided to ad some more stuff to it which are detailed below.


The Signature type boot program was obtained from a posting from someone
(Thanks to whoever...) on the newsgroup ALT.HACKERS on the (about) 27th
or 28th March, 1993. "SIG.COM" as it is known, came with 4 other small 
programs which were LIGHTS.COM, SCROLL.COM, CURSOR.COM and FLICKER.COM,
each being about 70 to 95 bytes TSR's. They were posted as part of an
"April Fool" type posting thread, which never got started. Shame!

Shameless Plug: Look out for my compilation of April Fools day TSR's
                and other useless progs around 25th-28th, March, '95, 
                on ALT.HACKERS.

Sig is a 167 byte VGA displaying program. It displays whatever and then a 
pretty colourful pattern is displayed in the background. On a DX66 or greater
the pattern looks quite "freak-out" type stuff. (Have you seen MINDWARP demo?)

You can enter up to 33 odd characters which will be displayed when the 
computer is booted and the floppy is left in the drive, and a small pretty 
pattern is displayed in the back ground.


Fire was obtained from the FTP site ftp.uwp.edu (can be found at any .ciac.
sites) in the directory \pub\msdos\demos\programming\sources, and called
FIRE.LZH. Fire was originally written by Jare of Vangelisteam (or the now
Iguana), about 9th-10th, May, 1993.

Fire is just that. A fire graphical display which was in 80 * 50 resolution
Included with this .ZIP file you should find FIRE.EXE, a workable cut down 
size of the original. Again, all credits to Jare of Iguana.

The original Fire is around 1500 bytes in size, and uses the 256 colour
palette. Since one sector is 512 bytes, Fire had to be cut down from it's
original size to 490-ish bytes. About half of the original size consists of
the pre-defined palette and something else, which were cut out. With the
palette not there, the effect really dies, but it is still there, and is
still quite a feat. When Fire was at around 450 bytes, it was found that 
it could still be decreased in size without any (more) loss of the Fire
effect. Currently it is around 380 bytes, and could be decreased about
another 100 bytes if only I could be bothered getting rid of the stack
segment thingy within Fire. At around 280 bytes, the effect would be quite
incredible. (well.... that's what I reckon anyway.)

With no pre-defined colour palette, Fire still looks at where the palette was
and will only find garbage - random data, quite possibly only a lot of 00's
in which case not very much will be displayed. The Fire is rather chunk-ish
and is on a green background. I guess the green can be changed to black, but
I like it! It stands out from the crowd!



DOS 5.0 is of course that... an original copy of the boot sector. So if you 
stuff up C: you can just copy this back onto your HD.

It doesn't matter which DOS version it comes from or what version you are
using. I could of wacked this v2.11 which I wrote this on and the people
using version 6.22 wouldn't of even realised!



My-Disk, just scrolls "THIS IS MY DISK" back and fourth. Useless.



Drive_A displays:
 "Not ready reading drive A"
 "Abort, Retry, Fail ?"

That's it!. it just keep looping around. Hopefuly making someone think that
A: drive is bung.



Drive_C displays:
 "Not ready reading drive C"
 "Abort, Retry, Fail ?"

That's it!. it just keep looping around. Hopefuly making someone think that
the hard drive is bung/cactus/dead.


Walk  - 2/3 of the screen "dissolves" and then a bloke walks from left to
        the right of the screen, over and over again.


Fill-COLOUR - just displays (in VGA) the colour range from colour 0 to 
              colour 255.
            

BOOT B: Drive. Now this is veryuseful. Do you have games which can only be
played from the floppy but it is in the other size format than your A:, ie
your B:?. Well... now... use this on a floppy in A: drive and it will then
boot B: drive, so, for example, I can play my original Lode Runner 5 ¬" disk
in my B: drive. - Not sure why I would want to do this - I've cracked it anyway.

Anyway BOOT B can be useful if you want it to be. 
(- grabbed from Scott A Numbers.)



BOOT C: This is proberbly the best on here. This will copy a bootstrap program
onto A: drive, so when it boots up, it will execute and then boot C:, as if
there was no disk in A: drive. It is like it does not see A: at all. 
This can be bloody handy if you are mucking around with a floppy in A: drive
and have to do a lot of booting.
(-grabbed from Bill Gibson's "Boot Thru", 1987)

Im not exactly sure what would happen if you were to place this onto C: drive,
I can only assume it would just keep booting itself and thus locking you
out from C: drive for a very long time, until you possibly you plugged it in
as D: and formatted it. Maybe. Anyway, I thought I had better disable from
copying this onto C: drive, as I did not want to try it. - It is DISABLED!.


CHANGING the SERIAL number - This can be handy if you want to keep track of
your disks, or wack on a specific sort of code. 

You MUST enter in eight (8), (7+1) hex digits, ie  0000-0001, FFFF-FFFF etc.

There is a bug here. - for me anyway. It wont always work first go, but
always on the second. I guess it is just that the disk-controller is just 
not resetting itself. See below.
If it doesn't go first time, try it again and it should change the number to 
your liking.  




Boot Fun will overwrite thus removing any viruses which may be sitting
in the boot sector, such as the Monkey Virus,  Michaelangelo (stop it from
being executed.), and other such common boot sector viri/viruses.

 - both I have caught off other peoples hard-drives.

...And I didn't think viruses could exist in the out back of Australia.


NOTE: No viruses whatsoever in any of these here .COM files. Well, not 
when they were .ZIP'd by me.


ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

2.0 How to use.

BootFun should be simple enough to use. It was made by a simple person. 
Myself.

Hit:  BOOTFUN   at the dos prompt and you will get no VGA 256 colour 
ray-traced menu system, no SB-32 AWE or GUS MAX support, actually no music
what-so-ever... what do you expect for about 2500 bytes?

What you will get is about a 10 lined very simple menu system that is fairly
bug-proof. How many bugs can fit into 2850 odd bytes - as opposed to a few ten
megabytes of Chiago, Win 95, OS/2, Win 3.1, Quake etc?

OK, hit from "1" to ":" for whatever one you want. 
Select either A:, B:, C: or D:.
Hit Y for Yes or any other key to exit back to menu. Hit ESC at the menu 
to quit. Simple?

If you want the Sig, which is rather cool, enter in the text that you want
to be displayed. Hit A: - D:, and then Y/N/ESC/any-other-key-not-to-do-it...
and that's it. Done.

      UP to 33 characetrs can be displayed. It isn't a great deal, but I 
      decided that it was enough to display whatever it is that you want to
      said, albeit a bit short.

Serial number is the same. Just enter in 8 hexadecimal digits.

Re-boot your computer and watch it. Then you'll have to re-boot to get out 
of it, this time, make sure you have taken the floppy out of the drive.


NOTE: There is no need to back up your disk. This program is safe! Has been 
      tested on many, many different floppies, and different systems, such as:

      Toshiba, DTK, Osborne, DEC, Wang, Sprinter, Olivetthingy, Acer, Multitech
      and others, and all came up perfect. No errors.

      ...But if you want to backup you data, or just try it with a newly 
      formatted floppy.... then go ahead. I can't stop you... not from where 
      I am at the moment.
      

2.1 Known Bugs.
      There are two bugs that I know of:.

	- Walk.    I spent too damn long on this trying to get it not to jump,
                   eventually I said "stuff it". - sorry.

	- Serial number changer. It will always work on the second go.

3.0 Warranty Stuff...

All other programs have this so why not this one? Ok, Let me see... If you
end up wrecking your HD or floppies in the event of using BootFun, don't sue
me. Your should of read in your manual where it says the words "BACKUP".
I am not in America where everyone sue's everyone else for breathing. 
I am a bloody Australian, and bloody Australian's don't crap on other people
If we get problems, we fix them and don't bother about getting compensation!
We are do-ers!, not lamers (Is that the correct word?).

...anyway, this stuff is all free-ware/public domain crap anyway. What do
   you expect for such stuff? I didn't cack up my floppies/HD with it, why  
   should it cack up on you - All pc-clones are supposed to be 100% compatible
   anyway aren't they? If your cacks up, BLAME YOUR MANUFACTURER!

So if you kill your A:/B:/C:/D: etc, you can write me mail asking for help
on how to go about fixing your A:/B:/C:/D: etc.

And if you really want to sue me, go ahead... all you will get is $2.50, and
this Toshiba T1000 Laptop that BootFun was written on.

BootFun is public domain crap. The question to be answered here is:
  "Should it be Public Domain or be deleted?"

BootFun will be uploaded to garbo.uwasa, simtel, and ciac ftp sites and 
(hopefully) to their mirrors.
