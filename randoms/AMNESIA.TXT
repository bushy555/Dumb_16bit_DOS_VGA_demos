Amnesia - 
Away from your troubles, Away from your pains...
Step into a world where it never rains...
There is no daytime, there is no night...
The enchanting wonders are all that's in sight.
A mysterious force has whisked you away...
To a place where anigma shall rule your day...
Your mind is at ease as you slowly subside...
Amnesia hath commeth, Amnesia has arrived.
-Daredevil.
