3D
---
3D - My ever on going quest with my version of Serpinski's 
gasket via a random number generator. Originally from an old
Apple ][e basic computer listing that my then computer teacher 
gave to me back in 1990. Watch it with proper red/blue 3D glasses.



3D-VIRUS
--------
Pretty much the same as above. View with 3D glasses.



ART
---
Abstract art. I call it 'dopey'.
Made by mistake.



DRAGON
------
Slight change to Serpinski's original does this.



PRETTY
------
I call it Pretty Crap. Ripped from some pascal listing that I found years ago.



SIG
---
Back in April 1994, someone posted on to alt.hackers a 
zip file which had a few 'April Fools' DOS TSR's which 
did various things - blinked keyboard lights, swapped caps 
lock around and one which was this VGA small demo program 
called SIG. It was around 170 bytes. Over the years I've
dabbled at it a little bit here and there and finally have
a use for it --- the 64 byte compo.



SLAB
----
Deep within Earth, halfway to its center in an area where Earth's 
core meets its mantle, lies a massive folded slab of rock that once 
was the ocean floor. The slab, which sank beneath North America some 
50 million years ago, holds important clues as to the behavior and 
composition of the deep interior of Earth and it could help explain 
how surface features such as volcanos and earthquakes form. The 
research team, led by Dr Seismologists at the University of Goob, 
detected slight movements in the slab over the past 24 hours. You are 
the leader of the elite underground drilling team who must now go 
underground, fly your drilling rig space ship to this sunken slab, 
record its surface temperature and bring back samples of the surface 
of the slab. Your mission appears to be neverending however it can 
all end by one push of the button. The power button.
Good luck, you're gonna need it.   

Controls: 
Up arrow: steers your ship green drilling ship upwards.
Down arrow: steers your green drilling ship down towards the sunken slab.

Accidently wrote this years ago by pure accident. It didn't 
do what it was supposed to, but it did create this.
