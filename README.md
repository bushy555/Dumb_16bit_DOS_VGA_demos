# Dumb_16bit_DOS_VGA_demos

Collection of dumb turbo pascal and 80286/80386 assembly VGA demos and small assembly competitons that I dribbled out years ago.
Uploaded so I didn't loose them through time. Like most source code from 30 years ago.

Most will work up until under x86 32-bit Windows XP command line.
Some of the pascal routines require turbo-pascal 16-bit Pascal libraries and will only work under DOS/Windows 3/Windows 95 or DOS emulation (DOS box)
